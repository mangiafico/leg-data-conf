In calculating a community<span class="ni">&amp;#x2019;</span>s revenues while determining cancellation, the Administrator shall exclude revenues for special districts and any other revenues that are required by law to be disbursed to other units of local government or used for specific purposes more limited than the scope allowed by the General Fund. In calculating a community<span class="ni">&amp;#x2019;</span>s expenses, the Administrator shall include disaster-related capital expenses for which the community has not been reimbursed by Federal or insurance proceeds, debt service expenses, and accrued but unpaid uncompensated absences (vacation and sick pay). In calculating the operating deficit of the local government, the Administrator shall also consider all interfund transfers. When considering the period following the disaster, the Administrator may consider a period of 3, 5, or 7 full fiscal years after the disaster, beginning on the date of the declaration, in determining eligibility for cancellation. The criteria for cancellation do not apply to those loans already cancelled in full. Applicants shall submit supplemental documentation in support of their applications for cancellation on or before April 30, 2014, and the Administrator shall issue determinations and resolve any appeals on or before April 30, 2015. Loans not cancelled in full shall be repaid not later than September 30, 2035. The Administrator may use funds provided under Public Law 109<span class="ni">&amp;#x2013;</span>88 to reimburse those communities that have repaid all or a portion of loans, including interest, provided as Special Community Disaster Loans under Public Law 109<span class="ni">&amp;#x2013;</span>88 or Public Law 109<span class="ni">&amp;#x2013;</span>234, as amended by section 4502 of Public Law 110<span class="ni">&amp;#x2013;</span>28.

In calculating a community&#226;&#128;&#153;s revenues while determining cancellation, the Administrator shall exclude revenues for special districts and any other revenues that are required by law to be disbursed to other units of local government or used for specific purposes more limited than the scope allowed by the General Fund. In calculating a community&#226;&#128;&#153;s expenses, the Administrator shall include disaster-related capital expenses for which the community has not been reimbursed by Federal or insurance proceeds, debt service expenses, and accrued but unpaid uncompensated absences (vacation and sick pay). In calculating the operating deficit of the local government, the Administrator shall also consider all interfund transfers. When considering the period following the disaster, the Administrator may consider a period of 3, 5, or 7 full fiscal years after the disaster, beginning on the date of the declaration, in determining eligibility for cancellation. The criteria for cancellation do not apply to those loans already cancelled in full. Applicants shall submit supplemental documentation in support of their applications for cancellation on or before April 30, 2014, and the Administrator shall issue determinations and resolve any appeals on or before April 30, 2015. Loans not cancelled in full shall be repaid not later than September 30, 2035.
